----------

- CLEANUP (canonical routing): Removed redundant include("postpress_ai.urls.routes_legacy")     # CHANGED:
  to avoid duplicate URL patterns and reverse-name collisions. Legacy routes remain            # CHANGED:
  available via explicit include("postpress_ai.urls.routes_legacy") wherever needed.           # CHANGED:
- KEEP: Canonical endpoints map directly to postpress_ai.views (public surface).               # CHANGED:

2025-08-16
- NEW FILE (canonical routing): Provide the canonical URLConf as a package
  module (`postpress_ai.urls`) exposing health/, version/, preview/, store/,
  and preview/debug-model/.
