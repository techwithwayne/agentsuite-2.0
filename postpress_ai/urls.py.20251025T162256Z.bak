# CHANGE LOG
# 2025-10-24: Add canonical URLConf that re-exports legacy routes for PostPress AI.
#             This allows project URLConf to include("postpress_ai.urls", namespace="postpress_ai")
#             without importing routes_legacy directly.

# Prefer the legacy router exported by the app itself.                                  # CHANGED:
